Web-Based Chat Application
I developed a compact chat application designed for peer communication, leveraging HTML and CSS for the frontend and Node.js for the backend functionality. The project involved creating a user-friendly interface for message exchange and ensuring robust backend support for message transmission and storage. Key features included the ability to send and receive messages in real time, as well as storing message history for user reference. This project not only enhanced my skills in web development but also provided practical experience in integrating frontend and backend technologies to build a functional and efficient chat system.
